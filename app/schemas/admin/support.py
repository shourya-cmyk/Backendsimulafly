"""Request/response schemas for the admin Support Center (Requirement 17).

The Support Center exposes a paginated/filterable ticket listing, a detail view
that carries the full message history, a respond action (appends a message), a
status-change action, and a consumer-only view. The listings reuse the shared
:class:`ListingEnvelope` so the Admin Panel consumes them with the same
pagination shape as every other directory.

SLA breach is a **derived** classification, never a stored column: a ticket is
breached when ``status != 'resolved' AND sla_due_at < now`` (R17.6). The flag is
computed at mapping time and surfaced as ``sla_breached`` on each ticket.

"""Admin API routers package.

Individual admin sub-routers live in this package (auth, rbac, accounts, etc.).
This module assembles an aggregating ``router`` that collects every admin
sub-router under a single mount. Each sub-router already declares
``prefix="/admin"``, so the aggregating router adds no prefix of its own —
final paths stay ``/admin/...`` and ``main.py`` mounts this package under
``/api/v1`` → ``/api/v1/admin/...``.

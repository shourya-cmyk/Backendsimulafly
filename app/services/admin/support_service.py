"""Support center service (R17 — support tickets).

``SupportService`` backs the admin ``support`` router. It reuses the shared
listing engine (:func:`app.services.admin.listing.paginate`) so search, the
status/priority/requester-type filters, sort, soft-delete exclusion, and
pagination behave identically to every other admin directory:

  * **List** tickets (paginated) — filterable by ``status``, ``priority``, and
    ``requester_type`` (conjunctively, R17.1, R17.2), sortable by a whitelist,
    excluding soft-deleted rows (R20/R22).
  * **Detail** — fetch a single ticket with its full message history eager
    loaded; a missing identifier raises HTTP 404 (R17.3, R17.8).
  * **Respond** — append exactly one :class:`SupportMessage` to the ticket's
    history and return the reloaded ticket (R17.4). The router wraps this in
    ``audited(...)`` so the action is recorded.
  * **Change status** — persist a new :class:`SupportTicketStatus` value
    (R17.5); also audited at the router boundary.
  * **Consumer view** — the same listing constrained to
    ``requester_type='consumer'`` (R17.7).

SLA breach is a **derived** classification, never stored: a ticket is breached
when ``status != 'resolved' AND sla_due_at < now`` (R17.6). :func:`is_sla_breached`
is the single shared predicate the router uses when mapping tickets to schemas.

This service owns only persistence-level logic and its invariants; the router
handles permission gating, auditing, and schema mapping.

"""Idempotent seed of the predefined RBAC roles and permission catalog.

Mirrors the ``app/services/style_seed.py::seed_if_empty`` bootstrap pattern:

  * ``seed_rbac_if_empty(db)`` — called from the FastAPI lifespan (wired in a
    later task). No-ops if the ``admin_roles`` table already has rows. Used for
    first-run / fresh-deploy bootstrap.

  * Module-as-script: ``python -m app.services.admin.rbac_seed`` — runs the
    seed against the configured DATABASE_URL. Pass ``--sync`` to force a
    reconciling upsert (insert any missing permissions/roles and attach any
    missing role→permission grants) even when the table is already populated.

The underlying insert routine is itself idempotent: it looks up every
permission by ``key`` and every role by ``name`` before inserting, and only
attaches role→permission grants that are not already present. Running the seed
twice therefore never creates duplicates (Requirements 2.1, 2.2).

RBAC model:
  * ``Permission`` — a granular capability string such as ``wallets.adjust``.
  * ``Role`` — a named bundle of permissions.
  * Super Admin holds the wildcard permission ``*`` which satisfies any check
    (see ``app/services/admin/rbac_service.py``).
